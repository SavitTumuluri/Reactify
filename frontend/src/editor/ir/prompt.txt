Do a full refactor of this code base. Follow good principles for refactoring a codebase you may be unfamilar with:
1) Analyze the codebase, frontend, and backend, determine the API to conform to. Identify areas of bloat, or error-prone libraries
2) Plan out a full refactor, including architecture designs to keep/change, and features to maintain. 
3) Keep full functionality. 
4) Maintain and enhance readability. Adopt clean architecture designs, take advantage
of helpful libraries, and software design principles/patterns. 
5) Minimize complexity, and maximize future maintainability/versatility.
